## Practicing more Git work flow: Merge conflicts.
### October 15th, 2018

> We have one new addition to our team, Jimmy. This week's assignment require us to make a contribution to each of our team's member's repo. That means that in my repo, I will start receiving many Pull requests to my repo. A merge conflict might come up, and I have to deal with it before finishin the merge. Editing the other team member's repo is easy enough. Had to deal with some function pointer. But so far all I have to do is move codes a few line down or up and this would fix the merge conflict. This assignment has been interesting because of some hands-on practice with function pointers.
