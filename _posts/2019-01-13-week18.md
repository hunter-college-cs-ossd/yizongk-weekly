## Progress: OUR PR WAS MERGED!
### January 13th, 2019

[The Issue we are working on!](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/23440)
[Our PR](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/27177)

We were able to solve all our previous bugs from our test and fixes by understanding the work flow of the activity-handler framework of DDA. All we had to do, was calculate the amount of time the unloading action would take, then assign that value to one of the activity-handler's struct variables. Then create a finish_function that is called by the activity-handler, which contains the "meat" of the action, the unloading action. 

After this, we wasn't experiencing our inventory crash bug, since we are properly removing items in the right order. YAY!
