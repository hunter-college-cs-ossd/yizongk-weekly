## Progress: Changing our scope of focus in the our effor to contribute codes to Cataclysm-DDA
### December 16th, 2018

[The Issue we are working on!](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/23440)

In previous weeks, we have selected an issue for our team to focus on. The issue we chose to focus was the uninteruptable action of unloading an ammo-belt. 

To give some context so that this bug may make sense... We chose DDA, which is a survival game in a world of post-apocalypse. There are harsh environments and monsters that you (the player) must survive in. This game is a single-player game.

The act of unloading an ammo-belt being uninteruptable was a bug, because if you unload an ammo-belt, it takes time to do so, and during this time, if a zombie were chasing you, there's no way to stop unloading to deal with the zombie. It means your player will be move-starved (unmovable and un-responsive), and you may died from the zombie during the unloadig period. 

We have talked with serveral devs on Discord, their IRC chat, and Discourse. One of the dev named [Kevin Granade](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/cs-students-looking-to-fix-issue-23440/17737/2) pointed to us a piece of code and an old fix to a similar issue that gave us pointers on how to approach fixing the unloading bug. He told us that DDA codes have a framework called Activity Handler, which manages actions that needs to be interuptable. At first glance, it seems like an easy fix, just move the "meat" of the function of unloading, into the Activity Handler framework, by creating a function that complies by the framework rules (simplly meaning, creating a function that takes in a player_activity and a pointer to the player instance). 

As we dig through the code, and after countless headaches 
(and help from another dev, mlangsdorf(Mark) on the offcial DDA Discord channel):

we realize many of the codes are badly organized. And we have come to a conclusion that moving the "meat" of the unloading action into the Activity Handler framework is almost impossible with the current state of organization. That is because, some of the core sub-functions are not accessible through any instance of player_activity class or player class (we only have access to these two class becasue of the Activity Handler framework rules). Those sub-functions are just floating around in the game.cpp which contains the core of the game, including the main game loop.

So to solve this bug, we need to do something else before attempting to sovle. We must move those floating sub-functions from game.cpp into the player class. Such functions as add_or_drop_with_msg() does make sense to be callable by a player, so we will move these floating functions into the player class. My teammate Alfred have opened up a new issue according to this. 

To sum up, we will reorganize the necessary functions that is related to the unloading bug, into the player class before attempting to fix the unloading bug.

## @update 12-19-18:

[Out attempted Pull Request](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/27177)

We have attempted to move unload() into activity_handler framework. It works and fixes the bug with one exception. After unloading, when trying to access inventory by pressing "i", the game crashes with segment fault. I suspect it may have to do with add_or_remove_with_msg() in player class or game.cpp. I may have to change the function to drop from inventory properfuly. We have also made a pull request, hopefully, we will get some help and feedback on this new found bug. My two teammates have been working hard with coding and testing, Ifti set up the activity_handler framework, I moved some functions into player class for easy access, and Alfred focus on testing, and fixing the resulting new bugs as well as putting up a Pull Request for further comments from other devs. This team is great.
