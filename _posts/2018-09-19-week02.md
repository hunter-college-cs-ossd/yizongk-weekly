## Reading About A Wikipedia Controversy
### September 19th, 2018

Has the author's word been treated fairly?
> I think Erika Herzog's ban was treated fairly, but the article about Catalina Cruz was treated unfairly. The article has been cited many times with many references. How credible? I am not sure, I am not familiar with their source credibility. But based on pictures of the politician, Catalina Cruz is truly advertising the things she claims to be fighting for. This shows that Catalina is notable, in my view. So I would say that the article should be kept.

Has the author been treated fairly?
> Now to the question of whether the author has been treated fairly. I would say yes, she has been treated fairly. Herzog referred to her own behavior as toxic, when it came to the discussions within the Wikimedia community. From personal experience, I find it very hard to be near a toxic person or to be willing to cooperate with that said person without being mentally harmed. Seeing that it is a harmful situation to be in a community with the author, I said her ban is reasonable. But again, this has nothing to do with the quality of the author's work. I think her article on Catalina Cruz is well done.

A little more on the topic of toxicity
- [Linus Toravlds steps down and is taking a break](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside)
> This is a recent article that Linus Torvalds wrote about the years of verbal abuse he has landed on many contributors to the Linux OS kernel. You can read about it, but the moral of the story is that no one likes an asshole, even if (s)he has done a great work. I personally don't hate or dislike Linus Torvalds, but I have read some of his comments to his fellow programmers. The comments are just rude, very toxic; I cannot see myself willing to help this person contribute anything, even if it's something great like the Linux OS (maybe not :), mentally I am still very motivated to contribute to Linux). Open Source work environment should not be like this.

About the definition of notability
> The definition of notability is definitely reasonable. To be notable means that many people can confirm something to be a fact. This means that Wikipedia will not have an article that tells lies. The whole world uses Wikipedia so it would be a disservice to its users if the information provided to them was not reliable. How does someone using this definition correctly come down to convincing the editors who hold the deciding vote. Whoever holds the deciding vote, must be convinced that the article is credible, and the way to prove credibility is by how many people can confirm a fact, and if many people know about a subject, that subject is notable. It seems very logical to me.
