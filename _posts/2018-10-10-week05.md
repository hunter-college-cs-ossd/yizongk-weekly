## More practice on Pull request and doing my merge from someone's Pull request.
### October 6th, 2018

> Our professor, Stewart Weiss, formed teams for us. My team member are Liudmila, Alfred, and Daniel. Process of this assignment was straight forward enough. We took turns making Pull request, and then waiting for it to merge. We were mostly quick about our merge and Pull. This entire Gitflow process seems much clearer as time pass, and impresses me about how easy it it to use. My question is what are the options to solve some Merge conflict?
