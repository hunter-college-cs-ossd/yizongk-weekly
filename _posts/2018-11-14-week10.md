## Steps to set up the environment for Cataclysm-DDA on my Ubuntu System
 * Head over to [Cataclysm-DDA Repo](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA), and fork it to your own repository (Click the 'fork' button on their github page).
 * Now, navigate to your copy of Cataclysm-DDA that you just forked. 
 * Clone your copy of Catacylsm-DDA to your local computer.
 * In your local computer, on the repo that you just cloned from your github, add an upstream to the original Cataclysm-DDA Repo.
 ```git
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA
 ``` 
 This allows you to get updates from the origin Cataclysm-DDA repo to keep your forked copy of the repo up to date.
 * Install some dependancies. [Cataclysm-DDA COMPILING](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/COMPILING.md)  
   Dependencies:  
   * ncurses or ncursesw (for multi-byte locales)
   * build essentials
 ```sh
 sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev build-essential
 ```
 * Building
 ```sh
 make
 ```
 * You are done! You can now make a branch on your forked copy and do your stuff. Then when ready, make a pull request to the official repo. NEVER merge from your local branches into your master branch. Only update the master branch by pulling from upstream/master.

## Issues that may need to be address.
 * Takes a long time to compile the game and test. Is there another to compile less thing to test?
