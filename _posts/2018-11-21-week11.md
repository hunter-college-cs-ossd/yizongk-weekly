## Progress: Coordinating with team, and searching for ways to compile in small executable for testing. 
### November 21th, 2018

This week, I have setted up the developer environment for Cataclysm-DDA. Was simple enough, just needed to pre-install some pre-requist some software. That part was easy, since everything was part of the ubuntu 'apt-get' package manager. I still have yet to find way to compile the program in small parts so it will be faster to test my implementations. 

I have also talked to my team during our wednesday meeting with the rest of Open Source Group at Hunter. We used HexChat for our little chat. Our Cataclysm-DDA group decides to plan our steps in slack. That's it for this week. Hopefully, we will get some progress toward contributing by the end of the week.
