## Git readings and first Pull request
### October 6th, 2018

> Did some light reading on our assignned book. And had the chance to do my first Pull request to my professor, Stewart Weiss. I coded a simple Hello World program which instead of printing "Hello World", I outputed some interesting information about myself. It was quickyl merged to the main repo, so that means I did it right. I am glad. Not much else happened for this week's assignment worth mentioning on my end.
